# Introduction to Statistical Learning
**Authors:** Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani


> Official website: [Link](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). The book was taught at Stanford University in summer of 2016 by the authors. The MOOC can be found online [here](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about).

My *attempted* solutions to exercises from the book. Code is in Python. A series of posts on my [blog](https://alisiina.github.io) summarizes concepts from the book.
