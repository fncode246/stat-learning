### Errors and correct conclusions in hypothesis testing
|             -       | $H_0$ True                    | $H_a$ True             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Do not reject $H_0$ | Correct conclusion   | Type II error `false negative` |
| Reject $H_0$        | Type I error `false positive` | Correct conclusion   |


### $p$-VALUE

A $p$-value is a probability that provides a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis $H_0$ provided by the sample. Smaller $p$-values indicate more evidence against $H_0$.

**Reject rule:** Reject $H_0$ if $p$-value $\leq a,$

where $a$ is the level of significance.
