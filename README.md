# [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
**Authors:** Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani


> The book was taught at Stanford University in summer of 2016 by the authors. The MOOC can be found [here](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about).

My *attempted* solutions to exercises from the book. Code is in **Python.** A series of posts on my [blog](https://alisiina.github.io) summarize concepts from the book.
